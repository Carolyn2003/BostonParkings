<p>
<me> Girls Who Code, is a Summer Immersion Program for teen girls to explore coding in a fun and friendly environment, with a purpose to have more women involved in Technology. Like us, we believe in girls' unlimited potential!
   The goals of this program, is to show the world that women can also code, and there's no one that can say that a guy knows more about Technology than a girl, because he is a guy. We want to end this gender gap in Tech
   because girls are being left behind.</me>
